"It is not uncommon for people to have small bumps or lumps in their mouth, and most of the time these are benign (non-cancerous) and not a cause for concern. However, it is always important to have any unusual growths or changes in your mouth evaluated by a dentist or other medical professional. There are many possible causes for a small round pink bump on the gum, including: A swollen papilla (the small, nipple-like structure that surrounds the base of a tooth) A small cyst (a fluid-filled sac) A minor infection or irritation in the gum tissue A small blood clot (a common occurrence after dental work or injury to the mouth) It is not possible to determine the specific cause of the bump without a proper examination by a dental professional. It is important to follow up with your dentist as recommended and to report any changes or concerns you have. Mouth cancer is rare in individuals who do not smoke or drink alcohol, but it is always important to have any unusual growths or changes in your mouth evaluated by a professional to rule out any potential serious conditions.",medicine,"What could be the reason for having a round pink bump between my lower front bottom teeth?I have a perfectly small round pink bump between my lower front bottom teeth on my gum and my dentist wants to see me in 6 weeks to see if it is gone, I am fearing mouth cancer!

"So the engine turns a stick that 's attached to a wheel called the flywheel . This is pressed up against a clutch pad , and the rotation from the engine is transferred from the flywheel through the clutch pad . When you press the clutch pedal , these two separate . The flywheel continues to spin , but ceases transferring this energy through the pad . Then you may move the shifting stick in the cab of your car to choose a different set of gears for different circumstances . In my car , this is because the shifting stick slides something called a dog clutch back and forth to meet the gear that is on one side of the dog clutch or the other . After you have selected a different gear , you slowly let go of the depressed clutch pedal and the rotating flywheel meets the clutch pad so it may once again transfer its rotational energy through the pad to the different gear you have selected .

"Lean manufacturing is a production philosophy that emphasizes the minimization of waste and the maximization of value. The goal of lean manufacturing is to create a highly efficient and effective production process that delivers the highest quality products to customers in the shortest time possible, while using the least amount of resources.\n\nLean manufacturing was developed by Toyota Motor Corporation in the 1950s, based on the principles of the Toyota Production System (TPS). TPS was developed by Taiichi Ohno, who is often referred to as the father of lean manufacturing. The TPS is a manufacturing approach that aims to eliminate waste, reduce variability, and increase efficiency by standardizing work processes and continuously improving them.\n\nOver the years, the principles of lean manufacturing have been adopted by a wide range of industries, including automotive, aerospace, healthcare, and electronics. The concept has also been applied to service industries, such as banking, insurance, and government agencies, to improve efficiency and effectiveness.",open_qa,what is lean manufacturing and who developed,ai

"During a concert, a singer who is wearing an earpiece is usually listening to a mix of the music and their own voice, which is called a ""monitor mix."" The monitor mix is typically different from the sound that the audience is hearing, as it is customized for the performer and helps them hear themselves better on stage. The singer's earpiece is connected to a device called a ""monitor console,"" which is operated by a person called a ""monitor engineer."" The monitor engineer is responsible for creating the monitor mix and adjusting it during the performance to suit the needs of the singer and the other performers. The monitor mix usually includes the instrumental tracks of the songs, along with any backing vocals or other sounds that the singer needs to hear in order to stay in time with the music and sing in tune.

"In American football, the team with possession of the ball (called the offense) has four chances, or downs, to move the ball 10 yards down the field. If they are successful in moving the ball 10 yards, they earn another set of downs. If the offense fails to move the ball 10 yards, possession of the ball is turned over to the other team (called the defense). One way for the offense to move the ball is by throwing it through the air (called a pass). The offense can also try to move the ball by running with it (called a rush). In the situation you are describing, it was probably considered ""bad"" for the Seattle Seahawks to pass the ball because it may not have been the most effective way for them to move the ball and get closer to scoring. There could be a number of reasons why passing the ball may not have been the best choice, such as the defense anticipating the pass and intercepting the ball, or the quarterback (the player who throws the ball) not having enough time to throw the ball due to pressure from the defense. It's also possible that the team had been trying to pass the ball and were not having success, and so it may have been more effective for them to try to run the ball or use a different strategy to try to move the ball down the field. Ultimately, the team's decision on whether to pass or run the ball will depend on a variety of factors, including the specific strengths and weaknesses of the offense and defense, the situation on the field, and the overall game plan.",reddit_eli5,"For someone who does n't watch NFL , why was it so bad for the Seahawks to pass the ball ?

"Traffic lights have three lights because they are used to control the flow of traffic at intersections.

"Small businesses can survive against big ones in a few different ways. One way is by offering something that the big businesses don't. For example, a small fast food restaurant might make all of their food from scratch, using fresh ingredients, while a big chain like McDonald's might use more processed ingredients. Customers who are looking for healthier or more high-quality food might choose the small restaurant over McDonald's. Another way that small businesses can compete is by offering a more personalized experience. For example, a small fast food restaurant might get to know their regular customers and offer them special deals or personalized service. This can make the small business feel like a more welcoming and friendly place to eat, which can be a big advantage over a big chain restaurant. Finally, small businesses can also try to compete by being more convenient or easier to access than big businesses.

An adrenaline shot, also known as an epinephrine injection, is a medication that can be used to treat a number of medical emergencies, such as a severe allergic reaction or a heart attack. The shot is usually given through a needle that is injected into the muscle, usually in the thigh or upper arm. When you receive an adrenaline shot, the medication is injected into your muscle and then quickly absorbed into your bloodstream. The adrenaline works to stimulate your heart and increase your blood pressure, which can help improve circulation and oxygen delivery to the body's tissues. It's important to note that the needle used for an adrenaline shot is much smaller than the ones used for other medical procedures, such as surgery. The needle is small enough to be easily inserted into the muscle without causing any damage to the heart or other organs.

"CAPTCHAs, or Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart, are designed to be difficult for computers to solve, but easy for humans. They are often used on websites to make sure that a real person, rather than a computer program, is interacting with the site. One reason why computers might have trouble solving CAPTCHAs is because they are designed to be difficult for computers to read. CAPTCHAs often use distorted or overlapping letters and numbers, and they may also include background noise or other visual distractions. These features make it difficult for a computer to recognize the characters in the CAPTCHA, even if it has an image recognition system. Another reason why computers might have trouble solving CAPTCHAs is because they are designed to be unpredictable. Different CAPTCHAs will look different each time they are shown, so a computer program that is designed to solve one CAPTCHA might not be able to solve another. This makes it difficult for computer programs to learn how to solve CAPTCHAs and makes them less effective at bypassing the test.

"Moving to a new city can be an exciting but also stressful experience, especially when it comes to financial planning and preparation. Here are a few steps you can take to help make the process smoother:Create a budget: Make a list of all the expenses you expect to incur during the move, including things like rent or mortgage payments, utilities, insurance, and transportation. Estimate the cost of each expense and add them up to get a total budget for the move. This will help you determine how much money you need to save or borrow to cover the costs.Save up: Start saving as much as you can in advance of the move. This will help reduce the financial burden of the move and give you a cushion in case of any unexpected expenses.Sell or donate items you don't need: Moving is a good opportunity to declutter and get rid of items you no longer need or use. This will not only save you money on packing and moving costs, but it can also help you earn some extra cash if you sell your items.Shop around for moving costs: Get quotes from different moving companies or rent a truck and do it yourself to find the most cost-effective option. You can also consider using a moving service that allows you to rent boxes and supplies, which can be more cost-effective than buying them outright.Consider temporary housing: If you're moving to a new city without a place to live yet, consider finding temporary housing while you search for a permanent home. This can help you avoid paying for a hotel or other costly accommodations.Set up utilities and other services: Research and compare the cost of utilities and other services in your new city to find the best deals.

"Simulated annealing (SA) is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. Specifically, it is a metaheuristic to approximate global optimization in a large search space for an optimization problem. It is often used when the search space is discrete (for example the traveling salesman problem, the boolean satisfiability problem, protein structure prediction, and job-shop scheduling). For problems where finding an approximate global optimum is more important than finding a precise local optimum in a fixed amount of time, simulated annealing may be preferable to exact algorithms such as gradient descent or branch and bound. The name of the algorithm comes from annealing in metallurgy, a technique involving heating and controlled cooling of a material to alter its physical properties. Both are attributes of the material that depend on their thermodynamic free energy. Heating and cooling the material affects both the temperature and the thermodynamic free energy or Gibbs energy. Simulated annealing can be used for very hard computational optimization problems where exact algorithms fail; even though it usually achieves an approximate solution to the global minimum, it could be enough for many practical problems. The problems solved by SA are currently formulated by an objective function of many variables, subject to several constraints. In practice, the constraint can be penalized as part of the objective function. Similar techniques have been independently introduced on several occasions, including Pincus (1970), Khachaturyan et al (1979, 1981), Kirkpatrick, Gelatt and Vecchi (1983), and Cerny (1985). In 1983, this approach was used by Kirkpatrick, Gelatt Jr., Vecchi, for a solution of the traveling salesman problem. They also proposed its current name, simulated annealing. This notion of slow cooling implemented in the simulated annealing algorithm is interpreted as a slow decrease in the probability of accepting worse solutions as the solution space is explored. Accepting worse solutions allows for a more extensive search for the global optimal solution. In general, simulated annealing algorithms work as follows. The temperature progressively decreases from an initial positive value to zero. At each time step, the algorithm randomly selects a solution close to the current one, measures its quality, and moves to it according to the temperature-dependent probabilities of selecting better or worse solutions, which during the search respectively remain at 1 (or positive) and decrease toward zero. The simulation can be performed either by a solution of kinetic equations for density functions or by using the stochastic sampling method. The method is an adaptation of the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm, a Monte Carlo method to generate sample states of a thermodynamic system, published by N. Metropolis et al. in 1953.",wiki_csai,"Please explain what is ""Simulated annealing""",human

"Generally , time dilation means clocks that are moving differently , or that are in different places , wo n't necessarily tick at the same rate . Since we 're going to be talking about pairs of clocks here , let 's go ahead and imagine one . In our imagination , these clocks are * ideal . * They just work by magic , if you like . They do n't have moving parts , they ca n't run down , they never malfunction , whatever . They 're perfect time - counting devices that tick once every second , no exceptions , no matter what . For sake of having something to call them , we 'll call them Clock A and Clock B. If Clock A is moving relative to Clock B , then Clock A will tick more slowly than Clock B does . How much more slowly is a function of how fast Clock A is moving relative to Clock B. It 's not a linear relationship , though . At "" normal "" speeds — the speeds human beings move around at — the difference is so tiny it 's really tough to measure . But at unimaginably high speeds , the difference is significant . If Clock A were moving at about 86 % of the speed of light relative to Clock B , then Clock B would tick twice for every tick of Clock A. If you 're clever , you 've already noticed something weird . If Clock A is moving relative to Clock B , Clock A ticks slower … but if Clock A is moving relative to Clock B then Clock B is * also * moving relative to Clock A … and that means Clock B has to tick slower ! How can two clocks tick more slowly than each other ? The answer is they just do . If you work through the math it all becomes clear , but the crux of the thing is that in order to compare how much time has elapsed on the two clocks , you have to bring them together so you can look at them both . This will involve * accelerating * at least one of the two clocks . If you consider Clock A to be the stationary clock and say that Clock B is rocketing past at 86 % of the speed of light , in order to compare them you have to bring Clock B to rest relative to Clock A. This breaks the symmetry of the situation , and will mean that Clock A ended up measuring more elapsed time than Clock B did . Again , explaining this * in detail * requires math , but these are the core ideas . The other kind of time dilation is gravitational . The more gravity a clock "" feels , "" the slower it ticks . So a clock that 's in the basement will tick more slowly that a clock that 's on the roof . Again , the difference at the altitudes humans live at is so tiny as to be really hard to measure — not impossible ; this has been tested with very precise clocks . But it 's so slight you 'll never notice it as you ride elevators up and down . It turns out these two effects are very closely linked . Remember how I said that you have to accelerate Clock B to bring it together with Clock A and compare them , and that that acceleration breaks symmetry ? That 's exactly the same effect as gravitational time dilation . See , gravitational time dilation is n't really about * gravity * as much as it is about * not falling . * If you 're in a gravitational field , in order to * not fall * you have to * accelerate upward . * When you stand on a diving board , it 's the upward acceleration of the board pushing against you that keeps you from falling . If the board breaks , that upward acceleration goes away , and you fall . It 's the upward acceleration involved in not falling that causes gravitational time dilation , in the same way that accelerating one of two differently moving clocks to bring them together breaks symmetry and results in one clock having measured more elapsed time than the other . Here 's your example : GPS satellites have clocks on them . These clocks send out the radio equivalent of a regular tick . Your phone or whatever computes its position by listening to the ticks of multiple satellites and comparing the time between them . So time — the regularity of a clock 's ticks — is a vital part of GPS . GPS satellites are high up , in Earth orbit . That means the clocks on them tick faster than clocks at sea level . But GPS satellites are also moving pretty fast , which means the clocks on them tick more slowly than clocks at sea level . These two effects do n't quite cancel out . The faster ticking caused by altitude is a bigger effect than the slower ticking caused by relative motion , so the net result is that GPS clocks gain about 38 microseconds every day compared to stationary clocks at sea level . ( The altitude makes the clock gain 45 microseconds a day , but the speed makes the clock lose 7 microseconds a day , so the net difference is a gain of 38 microseconds a day . )",reddit_eli5,Time dilation How does it work ?

"Here 's a more technical explanation : Music is all about tension and resolution . In happier and more upbeat music , tension is rare , usually in the form of the quickening of pace or increasing of volume- it is therefore less emotionally charged . Sad music is emphasizing dramatic tension yet charged with resolution . The resolution usually comes in the form of a change from dissonance ( sounds clashing ) to resonance ( sounds that are pleasant ) .

"Early Metal , often referred too as just "" Heavy Metal "" , like black Sabbath for example , took influences from rock and blues , to create a "" darker "" sound , often down - tuning their instruments slightly , writing more eerie / dark lyrics and often include vocals that use a more traditional/""normal "" style of vocals in their music . Thrash Metal= Took the darker tone and style of traditional metal bands such as black Sabbath , and merged that style with punk , creating a faster and more complex form of metal . Thrash is often fast and based around powerchord riffs with use of tremolo picking on the guitar , vocally is often a combination of rough shouting or some bands utilise more traditional singing into their sounds . Death Metal = Took influences from Thrash metal and basically pushed it to the extreme , both technically and vocally , so death metal is often very fast with deep growling vocals , often with disturbing lyrics , however from early on death metal would not just be very fast , throughout the evolution of death metal , bands have always been known to have slower sections within their music . Technical death metal = Fairly self explanatory , this style of death metal basically takes technical playing to the extreme , often using unpredictable song structures and highly technical musical ideas . Brutal Death Metal BDM pretty much death metal / tech death metal but with much much lower vocals , often referred too as "" guttural "" vocals , gutturals are "" wet "" sounding , incredibly deep vocals , because they are often difficult to decipher many bands in the style do not write lyrics , but use the vocals as an additional instrument . . Melodic Death metal = You guessed it , death metal with melody , it often uses less deep growls , more emphasis on melodic guitar solos ' etc . Black Metal = This style is often as extreme as death metal , but in a different way . Black metal often uses simple repetitive musical ideas that are developed upon , it is often based around minor powerchord riffs . Black metal is often very "" bleak "" and "" depressing "" in sound , with often raw "" hollow "" sounding production , black metal often has more "" croaked "" "" screeched "" or "" agonised "" sounding vocalisation . Symphonic Black Metal = Is basically black metal with the use of keyboards of orchestration to "" thicken "" the sound . I am not a fan , therefore do not have much to say on it . Doom Metal - takes influences from early metal such as Black Sabbath , death metal bands and black metal bands and combines them to create an often slow and depressing form of metal . This style often combines use of melody , and traditional singing with heavier sections . It is mostly characterised by its slow pace , depressing lyrics , and its use of many different "" moods "" within the music . Sludge Metal - I do not listen to much of this style , but I more or less know how to describe it . It is often a more raw / stripped back form of metal , combining early metal and thrash / doom to create a raw but powerful form of metal , usually with raspy vocals or a raspy singing style , is known to take influence from punk and speed up at times . Power Metal = a combination of traditional metal and thrash metal , it is often fairly fast , yet more upbeat and "" positive "" than death / thrash metal etc , it often utilises dramatic singing and an emphasis on the use of melody within song writing in general . It usually has a fast tempo , with vocals based around actual singing not "" growling "" etc Grindcore = This is usually incredibly fast and chaotic form of metal , which heavily takes musical ideas from hardcore punk and combines them with the aggression of death metal / thrash . It is known for having shouted vocals and ridiculously short songs . Progressive Metal = The term "" progressive "" can basically be put in front of any genre within metal , but to put it basicly , it is often more technical , both within what is being played and the time signature it is played in .

"Human beings have evolved over many thousands of years, and the way our bodies look and function today is the result of a long process of natural selection. Natural selection is a process that occurs in nature where organisms that are better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce. Over time, this can lead to changes in the way that a species looks and functions. One of the ways that human beings have adapted to their environment is by losing the thick coat of fur that many other mammals have. This may have happened because human beings developed the ability to make and wear clothing, which provided protection from the elements and allowed them to live in a wider range of environments. At the same time, human beings still have hair on their heads and faces. This hair serves several purposes. For example, the hair on our heads helps to keep us warm and provides some protection from the sun. The hair on our faces, particularly in men, may have evolved to signal social and sexual maturity, as well as to protect the face from injury. So, in short, the reason why human beings have evolved to lose their thick coats but still grow hair on their heads and faces is because these features have helped us to adapt to our environment and survive as a species.",reddit_eli5,Why have humans evolved so far as to lose their thick coats but still grow hair on their heads and faces ?

"It's normal to feel the urge to sneeze when looking into bright light, and you're definitely not the only one! This phenomenon is called the ""photic sneeze reflex,"" and it's actually a genetic trait that some people have. The reflex is caused by the interaction between the light-sensitive cells in the eye and the nerves that control the muscles in the nose. When bright light hits these cells, it can trigger a signal that travels along the nerves to the muscles in the nose, causing them to contract and produce a sneeze. It's not exactly clear why some people have this reflex and others don't, but it's thought to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Some researchers believe that the photic sneeze reflex may have evolved as a way to protect the eyes from bright light, although this is still a topic of scientific debate.

"The 1968 presidential election was won by Republican candidate Richard Nixon. There are a number of factors that may have contributed to the Democrats' defeat in that election. Some of the most significant factors include:\n\nVietnam War: The Vietnam War was a major issue in the 1968 election, and many voters were dissatisfied with the Democrats' handling of the conflict. This may have led some voters to support Nixon, who promised to bring an end to the war.\n\nSplit within the Democratic Party: The 1968 Democratic National Convention was marked by a split within the party, with some delegates supporting the more liberal candidates and others supporting the more conservative candidates. This division may have hurt the Democrats' chances in the election.\n\nEconomic issues: The economy was also a major issue in the 1968 election, and many voters were concerned about rising inflation and unemployment. Nixon was able to appeal to these voters by promising to address these issues.\n\nIncumbency: The Democrats had held the presidency for eight years prior to the 1968 election, and many voters may have been ready for a change.

"The Unexpected Hanging paradox is a thought experiment that involves a prisoner who is sentenced to be hanged. However, the executioner tells the prisoner that the hanging will take place at a random time within the next month, and the prisoner will not be told when the hanging will occur. The prisoner tries to figure out a way to survive the hanging, and he comes up with a plan. He reasons that if the executioner is going to hang him on a certain day, then he will know the day beforehand, because the executioner has to prepare for the hanging. So, the prisoner concludes that if he can eliminate all of the days when he knows the hanging will not take place, then he will be able to figure out the day when the hanging will occur. To eliminate the days when the hanging will not take place, the prisoner marks off each day on a calendar as it passes. On the first day, he marks off the first day on the calendar, and then he waits to see if he is going to be hanged. If he is not hanged, then he marks off the second day on the calendar, and so on. This continues until there is only one day left on the calendar, at which point the prisoner knows that the hanging must take place on that day. The paradox arises because the prisoner's logic seems to be flawed. Even if he is able to eliminate all of the days when the hanging will not take place, he still does not know when the hanging will occur. This is because the executioner could have chosen any day to hang the prisoner, and the prisoner's plan does not take that into account. So, the prisoner's logic does not actually help him figure out when the hanging will take place, and the paradox remains unsolved.",reddit_eli5,"The Unexpected Hanging paradox .

"American call options are generally considered to be more valuable than European call options because they give the holder the right to exercise the option at any time prior to expiration. This means that the holder of an American call option can choose to exercise the option and receive the underlying asset at the strike price at any point before the option expires, while the holder of a European call option can only exercise the option at expiration.The ability to exercise an option at any time can be especially valuable if the underlying asset pays cash flows, such as dividends or interest payments, because these cash flows can increase the value of the option. For example, if an investor holds a call option on a stock that pays dividends, and the stock's price is below the strike price of the option, the investor may choose to exercise the option and receive the stock before the dividend payment is made. This allows the investor to capture the value of the dividend payment and potentially sell the stock for a profit.In general, the value of an option is determined by a number of factors, including the underlying asset's price, the option's strike price, the option's expiration date, the underlying asset's volatility, and the time remaining until expiration. All of these factors can affect the value of an option, and the specific impact of each factor will depend on the specific circumstances of the option.",finance,Why are american call options more valuable than european options ONLY if the underlying asset pays cash flows?,ai
"Optimization, in mathematics, refers to the process of finding the maximum or minimum value of a function. This can be expressed as a problem of the form: Given a function f(x) and a set of constraints on the variables x, find the values of x that minimize or maximize the function f(x). Optimization problems can be classified into two types: linear and nonlinear. Linear optimization problems involve functions that are linear in the variables, while nonlinear optimization problems involve functions that are not linear. There are many different techniques for solving optimization problems, including gradient descent, the simplex method, and the Newton-Raphson method. The choice of method will depend on the specific problem being solved and the characteristics of the function being optimized. Optimization techniques are widely used in fields such as engineering, economics, and computer science to solve a variety of practical problems. For example, optimization can be used to design efficient transportation systems, to optimize the production of goods and services, and to find the best strategy for solving a problem in computer science.",wiki_csai,"Please explain what is ""Optimization (mathematics)""",ai

There was one case in Massachusetts ( a hotbed of art crime ) where the DA told a criminal they could negotiate lower charges for a different crime if he helped them recover a Rembrandt . His affiliates stole a Rembrandt a few weeks later and he helped the DA "" recover "" it to get the charges reduced . So unfortunately ( though movies like the Thomas Crowne Affair and Dr. No are excellent , ) most art crimes are n't on behalf of a rich collector , but are committed by common , lower class criminals . The only case that I can think of that does n't fit any of the normal art thefts is the case of Stephane Breitwieser who stole hundreds of millions of dollars worth of art just because he liked it .

"Toothbrushing tools date back to 3500 - 3000 BC when the Babylonians and the Egyptians made a brush by fraying the end of a twig . Tombs of the ancient Egyptians have been found containing toothsticks alongside their owners . Around 1600BC , the Chinese developed "" chewing sticks "" which were made from aromatic tree twigs to freshen breath . The Chinese are believed to have invented the first natural bristle toothbrush made from the bristles from pigs ' necks in the 15th century , with the bristles attached to a bone or bamboo handle . When it was brought from China to Europe , this design was adapted and often used softer horsehairs which many Europeans preferred . Other designs in Europe used feathers . The first toothbrush of a more modern design was made by William Addis in England around 1780 – the handle was carved from cattle bone and the brush portion was still made from swine bristles . In 1844 , the first 3 - row bristle brush was designed . Egyptians are believed to have started using a paste to clean their teeth around 5000BC , before toothbrushes were invented . Ancient Greeks and Romans are known to have used toothpastes , and people in China and India first used toothpaste around 500BC . Ancient toothpastes were used to treat some of the same concerns that we have today – keeping teeth and gums clean , whitening teeth and freshening breath . The ingredients of ancient toothpastes were however very different and varied . Ingredients used included a powder of ox hooves ' ashes and burnt eggshells , that was combined with pumice . The Greeks and Romans favored more abrasiveness and their toothpaste ingredients included crushed bones and oyster shells . The Romans added more flavoring to help with bad breath , as well as powdered charcoal and bark .

"Why would someone invest in other instruments (e.g. stocks) to pay for childrens' college education when the capital gains on those are taxed, unlike a home equity loan? Many tax advantageous vehicles exist for the purpose of saving for college education such as 529 plans, Roth IRAs, Series EE and I bonds. Tax and penalty free distributions from a portfolio of stocks is possible if the distributions are for qualified education expenses and the account is in the form of a Roth IRA. A house is collateral for a home equity line of credit. A combination of unfortunate events could cause someone to default on the loan and loose their residence. Also, the tax advantages of 529 plans, and Roth IRAs are not applicable to purchase a motor boat. With respect, some people like to leave the home equity loan untapped for other uses. More Details: 529 plans are not taxed by on the Federal level when the withdraws are used for college. In many states, contributions to state sponsored 529 plans are deductible on the state level. These are not self directed so you can't trade stocks/bonds in a 529 plan, however, certain plans allow you to lock in the rate you pay for credit at today's prices. If you want a self directed (ability to trade stocks/bonds) vehicle with tax free disbursements for qualified education, consider a Roth IRA. There are yearly contribution limits, and penalty if the proceeds are not used for qualified educational expenses. Also I believe interest revenue from Series EE and I bonds is tax free if the bond is used for education. There are special conditions and situations to 529 plans, Roth IRAs, Series EE and I bonds, the purpose of this answer was to expand upon the tax advantageous vehicles for higher education.",finance,Do you avoid tax when taking a home equity loan?,human

"Barack Obama - His main objective from listening to his speeches is to make sure that the wealthiest 1 % of Americans ( and corporations ) pay their fair share of taxes because he feels like with tax loopholes that rich people are getting off too easy . He is also big on social help programs for the poor such as government healthcare , social security , welfare , food stamps , etc . His views on the national debt is that he is not worried about it because we mostly owe money to ourselves . Thus , Obama is a big proponent of large spending and the government solving the countries problems . His foreign policy is pretty muddled . Many of his supporters thought that he was the peace candidate heading into 2008 but that has not really been the case . Mitt Romney - I see Romney as a big proponent of trickle down economics . In other words , he wants to make the tax burden on the rich and corporations to be less because he feels that the rich are the job creators in America . In his eyes , raising taxes on corporations will only cause them to outsource jobs to other countries , and make American companies less competitive on a world market . Thus , tax breaks for the rich is the best way to stimulate the economy in his opinion . Other than that , I have a hard time getting a read on Romney 's main political beliefs . His views have changed over time and depending on who he talks to . I see him as someone who would not do anything drastic or controversial in fear of a backlash , so in that sense he is a "" more of the same "" candidate . Newt Gingrich - Gingrich is a former disgraced Speaker of the House who was essentially kicked out of politics because of corruption . I am amazed that he is still relevent . He presents himself as an intellegent guy with big ideas in debates , such as having a flat tax rate for everyone , restructuring social security to make it private , and other conservative issues . He is power hungry and wants the president to be able to overrule the Supreme Court when he disagrees . Another characterstic of Gingrich is his hostility towards Obama and Democrats . He is more combative that most politicians and is not afraid to play hardball or bend the rules to get his way . Ron Paul - Paul wants the US to shrink the government to the way that the Constitution intended . That means his domestic policy would be extremely low taxes and extremely low spending . He views government agencies ( like the Department of Education , and the Environmental Protection Agency ) as entities that cause more harm than good . In other words , if the government is too powerful then it is vulnerable to corruption and influence from rich corporations . He is unique among candidates in that he wants to bring home all of the troops and end all foreign aid . He is against almost all federal regulations ( including internet censorship and federal drug laws ) because he feels like people should have the freedom to do whatever they want as long as they do n't hurt other people . He is also unique among candidates in that he wants to get rid of the Federal Reserve bank and go back to a gold standard . He is by far the most fiscally conservative candidate . Rick Santorum - His main platform is that he is extremely pro - life and religious . He plays this up in his campaign in order to get the christian vote .

"The number of electrons in each shell of an atom is determined by the electron configuration of the atom. The electron configuration is a shorthand notation that specifies the arrangement of electrons in an atom. It is based on the quantum mechanical model of the atom, which explains the behavior of electrons in terms of quantum states.\n\nIn general, electrons occupy the lowest energy levels (also called shells) first. The first shell can hold up to 2 electrons, the second shell can hold up to 8 electrons, and the third shell can hold up to 18 electrons. These are the general rules, but there are some exceptions.\n\nFor example, the fourth shell can hold up to 32 electrons, but it is not completely filled in most atoms. This is because the energy required to add an electron to a higher energy level becomes increasingly larger as the atomic number (the number of protons in the nucleus) increases. As a result, it becomes increasingly difficult for atoms to add more electrons to higher energy levels, and the electrons tend to fill the lower energy levels first.\n\nThe electron configuration of an atom can be calculated using the periodic table and the aufbau principle, which states that electrons occupy the lowest energy levels first. The electron configurations of the elements are listed in the periodic table, and they can be used to predict the properties of the elements and the chemical behavior of the atoms.",open_qa,how are the # of electrons in each shell determined,ai
"In order to understand how a computer knows if a binary code represents a letter or a number, we need to first understand how computers store and represent data. Computers store data using bits, which are units of information that can have one of two values: 0 or 1. When we group several bits together, we can represent different types of data, such as letters, numbers, and symbols. One way that computers can represent letters and numbers is by using a code called ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). ASCII is a standard that assigns a unique number to each letter, number, and symbol in the English language. For example, the ASCII code for the letter ""A"" is 65, the ASCII code for the letter ""B"" is 66, and so on. So when a computer sees a binary code like 01100001, it knows that this code represents a letter because it has been programmed to recognize the ASCII codes for letters. In this case, the computer knows that 01100001 is the ASCII code for the letter ""a"". I hope this helps to explain how computers know whether a binary code represents a letter or a number.

"Video tracking is the process of detecting and analyzing the movement of objects in a video sequence. It involves analyzing the video frame by frame, identifying objects of interest (such as people, cars, or animals), and following their movement as they appear in subsequent frames. This can be done manually, by a person watching the video and manually tracking the movement of the objects, or it can be done automatically, using computer algorithms that analyze the video and track the movement of the objects automatically. Video tracking has a variety of applications, including surveillance, traffic analysis, sports analysis, and entertainment. In surveillance, video tracking can be used to automatically detect and alert security personnel to suspicious activity, such as a person loitering in a restricted area. In traffic analysis, video tracking can be used to automatically count the number of vehicles passing through an intersection, or to measure the speed and flow of traffic. In sports analysis, video tracking can be used to analyze the performance of athletes, or to provide detailed analysis of specific plays or game situations. In entertainment, video tracking can be used to create special effects, such as inserting a character into a live-action scene or creating interactive experiences for users.",wiki_csai,"Please explain what is ""Video tracking""",ai

"Limits are a rigorous way to talk about approximation . Particularly , approximations that you can do with arbitrarily good accuracy . Limits are sophisticated instructions that we can use to approximate value to arbitrarily good precision . Choose any error that you can live with , then you can use the instructions contained in a limit to be guaranteed that you 'll have an approximation that is within your error . For instance , we have that the limit of sin(pi\*x)/x at x=0 is pi . If you then want to approximate pi to , say , two digits , then we can read the instructions for the limit ( the proof that it works ) and find that as along as we choose some small enough x , then we can just plug in that x and get a close enough evaluation . Luckily , we can compute sin(pi/96 ) by hand , and so if we just pick x=1/96 , then follow through with the computation , the output will be something close enough to pi . ( This is , essentially , in modern language , what Archimedes did to approximate pi . ) If you know that the limit of f(x ) at x = A is L , then this means that for any error of your choosing , which we denote by E , then there will be some deviation from A , which we denote D , so that for any x whose distance from A is less than D , then you are guaranteed that the distance that f(A ) is from L will be less than E. This is a very precise way to talk about approximating the value L using the function f(x ) . Pretty much anytime you use an approximation in math , we know that it works because someone , somewhere , as proved that a limit works out . Taylor series approximate function because of limits . Newton 's Method approximates zeros because of limits . The arithmetic mean approximates the true mean because of limits . The computational time of algorithms scale in a certain way because of limits . The derivatives work because the approximate the slope of secant lines giving by close - by points .

"The opposite of an economic bubble is a bubble burst :p! Jokes aside though, an economic bubble occurs when the economy is in bull market mode and asset prices are growing very fast. It's usually measured by ratio's like price to earnings and the levels of various market indices. So, the opposite would be when valuations are falling very fast or are very low, and price to earnings ratios are low. This condition is usually a recession. A recession is a market slowdown, generally after a bubble bursts, and severe recessions can become depressions if they last long enough (Great Depression, 1930s). A bubble is not necessarily negative - stock prices usually rise a lot so paper wealth is greatly magnified. If you can get out in time, you're golden. Similarly, a recession isn't bad for everyone. Some investors keep large amounts of cash waiting for recessions so they can ""buy low, sell high"".

"I guess I don't understand how you figure that taking out a car loan for $20k will result in adding $20k in equity. A car loan is a liability, not an asset like your $100k in cash. Besides, you don't get a dollar-for-dollar consideration when figuring a car's value against the loan it is encumbered by. In other words, the car is only worth what someone's willing to pay for it, not what your loan amount on it is. Remember that taking on a loan will increase your debt-to-income ratio, which is always a factor when trying to obtain a mortgage. At the same time, taking on new debt just prior to shopping for a mortgage could make it more difficult to find a lender. Every time a credit report (hard inquiry) is run on you, it temporarily impacts your credit score. The only exception to this rule is when it comes to mortgages. In the U.S., the way it works is that once you start shopping for a mortgage with lenders, for the next 30 days, additional inquiries into your credit report for purposes of mortgage funding do not count against your credit score, so it's a ""freebie"" in a way. You can't use this to shop for any other kind of credit, but the purpose is to allow you a chance to shop for the best mortgage rate you can get without adversely impacting your credit. In the end, my advice is to stop looking at how much house you can buy, and instead focus on a house with payments you can live with and afford. Trying to buy the most house based on what someone's willing to lend you leaves no room in the near-term for being able to borrow if the property has some repair needs, you want to furnish/upgrade it, or for any other unanticipated need which may arise that requires credit. Don't paint yourself into a corner. Just because you can borrow big doesn't mean you should borrow big. I hope this helps. Good luck!",finance,Take car loan out of mortgage to improve equity,human

"When an object bounces, it means that it is returning to its original shape after being squished or deformed when it hits something. When an object is squished or deformed, energy is stored in it. When the object returns to its original shape, that energy is released, which makes the object bounce. For example, when a bouncy ball is dropped onto a hard surface, it will compress or squash as it hits the surface. This causes energy to be stored in the ball. When the ball returns to its original shape, it releases that energy and bounces back up into the air. The amount that an object bounces depends on a few different factors, such as the material it is made of and the surface it is bouncing on. Some materials are more bouncy than others because they can stretch and return to their original shape more easily.

In finance and economics, ""beta"" is a measure of the volatility of an investment or asset, compared to the overall market.

"In Canada, an RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan) is a type of tax-advantaged account that is designed to help individuals save for retirement. One way to contribute to an RRSP is by making a significant purchase, which is a lump-sum contribution of a large amount of money.If you want to defer claiming a significant purchase of RRSPs, it means that you will not include the contribution on your tax return for the year in which you made it. Instead, you will carry forward the contribution and claim it in a future tax year. This can be beneficial if you expect your income to be higher in the future, as you will be able to claim the contribution when your marginal tax rate is higher and get a larger tax refund.To defer claiming a significant purchase of RRSPs, you must complete Form T1213, Request to Reduce Tax Deductions at Source, and submit it to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). You will need to provide information about your income, RRSP contributions, and other factors that may affect your tax deductions. The CRA will review your request and determine whether you are eligible to defer your RRSP contribution. If you are approved, you will receive a notice of assessment or reassessment indicating the amount of your deferred contribution and the tax year in which you can claim it.It's important to note that there are limits on the amount of RRSP contributions that you can defer, and you may be required to pay a tax penalty if you exceed these limits. You should also be aware that deferring your RRSP contribution may not always result in a larger tax refund, as your tax situation may change in the future.

"The ""www"" at the beginning of a website's address stands for ""World Wide Web."" It's a way to identify the website as being part of the internet. Back in the old days, when the internet was new, people used to have to type ""http://"" before the address of a website, and that stands for ""HyperText Transfer Protocol."" But now, most web browsers automatically add the ""http://"" part, so you don't have to type it in.\n\nThe ""www"" part is still used because it helps to identify the website as being part of the internet, and it also helps to differentiate it from other types of websites that might not use ""www.""

"Babies, puppies, and kittens are often considered cute because they have physical features that are designed to elicit a nurturing response from adults. These features include large eyes, round and chubby faces, and soft, smooth fur. In evolutionary terms, these features may have developed as a way to ensure the survival and reproduction of the species. When an adult feels a strong desire to take care of and protect a baby, puppy, or kitten, they are more likely to invest time and resources in caring for the young animal. This can help the young animal grow and develop into a healthy adult, increasing the chances that they will be able to reproduce and pass on their genes to future generations.

"Here are a few tips for avoiding getting back into debt:Create a budget: Start by understanding your income and expenses. Determine how much you can afford to pay towards debt each month, and use a budget to track your spending and make sure you are staying on track.Pay off high-interest debt first: If you have multiple debts with different interest rates, focus on paying off the ones with the highest interest rates first. This will save you money in the long run as you will pay less in interest.Cut expenses: Look for ways to cut unnecessary expenses so you can free up more money to put towards debt repayment. This might include things like cancelling subscriptions, eating out less, or finding ways to save on groceries.Increase income: If you are having trouble making ends meet, consider ways to increase your income. This might involve taking on a part-time job or starting a side hustle.Seek help: If you are struggling to manage your debt and are having difficulty making payments, don't be afraid to seek help. You may be able to negotiate with creditors to lower your payments or interest rates, or you may want to consider working with a credit counselor or financial planner to get your finances back on track.",finance,How to avoid getting back into debt?,ai
"Investors and shareholders are both people who own a part of a company, but they can have slightly different roles and relationships with the company.\n\nAn investor is someone who puts money into a company with the expectation of making a profit.

"Keep in mind , Tolkien never gave details on the powers of the Ring . However , the general theme of how evil lords could triumph in his stories is twofold : - by dominating the minds of evil - inclined creatures through a mix of fear and sheer mental compulsion - by corrupting the minds of creatures that are not necessarily evil ( like men , dwarfs , elves ) through fear , false promises , visions The One Ring amplified these powers in proportion to how developed they already were . Galadriel could already read and influence minds ; with the Ring , she could have invaded them at will . Aragorn was already incredibly charismatic ; with the Ring , armies would flock to him and warriors would fight fanatically under his standards . The Ring would have given any one of them the military power to defeat Sauron . And then , after they had sat themselves on the throne as victors , it would have corrupted them . It would have started innocently enough : a disagreement , a dispute , and instead of settling it through diplomacy they would have just used their power ( military or the Ring 's ) to get their way .

"An academic discipline or academic field is a subdivision of knowledge that is taught and researched at the college or university level. Disciplines are defined (in part) and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published, and the learned societies and academic departments or faculties within colleges and universities to which their practitioners belong. Academic disciplines are conventionally divided into the humanities, including language, art and cultural studies, and the scientific disciplines, such as physics, chemistry, and biology; the social sciences are sometimes considered a third category. Individuals associated with academic disciplines are commonly referred to as experts or specialists. Others, who may have studied liberal arts or systems theory rather than concentrating in a specific academic discipline, are classified as generalists. While academic disciplines in and of themselves are more or less focused practices, scholarly approaches such as multidisciplinarity/interdisciplinarity, transdisciplinarity, and cross-disciplinarity integrate aspects from multiple academic disciplines, therefore addressing any problems that may arise from narrow concentration within specialized fields of study. For example, professionals may encounter trouble communicating across academic disciplines because of differences in language, specified concepts, or methodology. Some researchers believe that academic disciplines may, in the future, be replaced by what is known as Mode 2 or ""post-academic science"", which involves the acquisition of cross-disciplinary knowledge through the collaboration of specialists from various academic disciplines. It is also known as a field of study, field of inquiry, research field and branch of knowledge.

"Equity is the portion of your home that you own outright, or the value of your home that you have paid off through mortgage payments. Building up equity in your home can have several advantages:It can act as a financial cushion: Having a significant amount of equity in your home can provide financial security and give you a sense of financial stability. If you face an unexpected financial hardship or need to make a major purchase, you may be able to tap into your home equity through a home equity loan or a cash-out refinance.It can increase the value of your home: As you pay off your mortgage and build up equity in your home, the value of your home may increase. This can be especially beneficial if you decide to sell your home in the future, as you may be able to sell it for more than you paid for it.It can lower your monthly mortgage payments: As you pay down your mortgage and build up equity in your home, the amount of your mortgage that is based on the unpaid principal balance will decrease. This can lead to a lower monthly mortgage payment.It can make it easier to refinance: If you have a significant amount of equity in your home, it may be easier to qualify for a lower interest rate when you refinance your mortgage. A lower interest rate can save you money on your monthly mortgage payments and help you pay off your mortgage faster.Overall, building up equity in your home can be a smart financial move that can provide financial security, increase the value of your home, and potentially save you money on your monthly mortgage payments.",finance,"What is the true value, i.e. advantages or benefits, of building up equity in your home?",ai
"Radiation is a type of energy that is emitted by certain materials, such as radioactive elements. It is possible to feel the effects of radiation, but it depends on the type of radiation and the amount of exposure.Alpha radiation is made up of alpha particles, which are made up of two protons and two neutrons. Alpha particles are not very penetrating, which means they do not travel very far through matter. If you were to touch something that was emitting alpha radiation, you might feel a slight warmth or tingling sensation. However, alpha particles are not very harmful because they can be stopped by a sheet of paper or a few centimeters of air.Beta radiation is made up of beta particles, which are high-energy electrons or positrons. Beta particles are more penetrating than alpha particles and can travel through a few centimeters of wood or a few millimeters of aluminum. If you were to touch something that was emitting beta radiation, you might feel a slight burn or radiation sickness. Beta particles can be harmful if you are exposed to them for a long time or if you receive a high dose of radiation.Gamma radiation is made up of high-energy photons, which are particles of light. Gamma radiation is very penetrating and can pass through several centimeters of lead or several meters of concrete. If you were to touch something that was emitting gamma radiation, you might not feel anything at all, because gamma radiation does not interact with the body in the same way that alpha or beta particles do. Gamma radiation can be harmful if you receive a high dose of radiation, but it is not possible to feel the difference between alpha, beta, and gamma radiation just by touch.",reddit_eli5,"Can I feel radiation ?

"In a communist government, the ruling party or group is typically the Communist Party, which is a political party that believes in the principles of communism. In a communist government, the ruling party has control over the political, economic, and social systems of the country and aims to establish a classless, egalitarian society in which the means of production are owned and controlled by the community as a whole, rather than by individuals or corporations. In a communist government, decision-making is typically centralized and the government plays a key role in the planning and management of the economy and society. The government is typically led by a single party or a small group of individuals who hold positions of leadership within the Communist Party.\n\nIt's important to note that the concept of communism as a form of government has been controversial and has been implemented in various ways throughout history, with varying degrees of success. Some communist governments have been authoritarian, with a small group of leaders exerting control over the population and suppressing political opposition. Other communist governments have been more democratic, with power shared among a larger group of people and more open political discourse.",open_qa,who rules communism government,ai

"Sure! The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle named after the host of the game show ""Let's Make a Deal"". It goes like this: Imagine you are a contestant on a game show, and the host (Monty Hall) shows you three doors. Behind one of the doors is a prize, and behind the other two doors are nothing. You get to choose one of the doors, and then Monty will open one of the other doors to reveal that it is empty. Finally, Monty will ask you if you want to stick with your original choice or switch to the remaining unopened door. Now here's the question: should you stick with your original choice or switch to the other door?, Intuitively, it might seem like it doesn't matter whether you stick with your original choice or switch, since there are only two doors left and the prize could be behind either one. But the surprising answer is that you should switch doors!, To see why, let's imagine that you choose door #1. There is a 1/3 chance that the prize is behind door #1 (since there are three doors in total and the prize is behind one of them), and a 2/3 chance that the prize is behind one of the other two doors. If the prize is behind door #1, then it doesn't matter whether you stick with your original choice or switch, since you've already chosen the correct door. But if the prize is behind one of the other two doors, then switching doors will give you the prize, while sticking with your original choice will not. So overall, there is a 2/3 chance that switching doors will give you the prize, while there is only a 1/3 chance that sticking with your original choice will give you the prize. That means that switching doors is the better choice in this situation. I hope that helps!

"There are many reasons why human teeth can grow crooked. Some of these reasons are genetic, while others are due to environmental factors. Here are a few possible causes: Genetics: Some people are simply more prone to crooked teeth due to inherited characteristics. This can be due to the size and shape of the jaw, or the way the teeth are aligned in the mouth. Crowding: If there isn't enough space in the mouth for all of the teeth, they may become crooked as they try to find a place to fit. This can be caused by genetics (such as having a small jaw), or it can be due to habits like thumb sucking or prolonged use of a pacifier. Misalignment: If the teeth or jaw are misaligned, it can cause the teeth to grow crooked. This can be due to genetics, or it can be caused by injuries or other health conditions. Poor oral hygiene: If someone doesn't brush and floss their teeth regularly, it can lead to a build-up of plaque and tartar, which can cause the teeth to become crooked or misaligned.

Your savings portfolio may be focused on short-term goals, such as saving for a down payment on a house or a car, and may therefore be more conservative in nature. Your retirement portfolio, on the other hand, is likely to have a longer time horizon, as you will not be accessing the funds for many years. As a result, it may be more appropriate to take on more risk in your retirement portfolio, as you have more time to ride out market fluctuations and potentially earn higher returns. That being said, the specific mix of assets that is appropriate for your retirement portfolio will depend on your individual circumstances, such as your age, risk tolerance, and time horizon.

What is also claimed is that at one point , the Church started hunting down and killing these illuminati members and so the remaining members took refuge within another organization known as the Freemasons . You see , several people who have gained power have been said to be Freemasons and since Freemasonry is an organization with quite a vivid history ( there was a time where you HAD to say you whether you were a Freemason or you would face consequences ) . Because not a lot of Freemasons go around yelling "" I 'm a Freemason "" , people have considered this secretive and have as such related this organization to the illuminati .

"In Argentina, the government sometimes places controls on the exchange of its currency, the Argentine peso, for other currencies, such as the US dollar. This can be done for a variety of reasons, such as to try to stabilize the value of the peso or to conserve foreign exchange reserves. When the government places controls on currency exchange, it can become difficult or expensive for people to exchange pesos for other currencies through official channels. This can create demand for a black market, where people can exchange currencies illegally at rates that differ from the official exchange rate set by the government. The ""blue dollar,"" also known as the ""blue chip swap,"" is a term used to refer to the exchange of US dollars for pesos on the black market in Argentina. The term ""blue"" is often used because it was once common for people to use blue ink to write the amount of money being exchanged on a piece of paper as a receipt.

"Sample complexity refers to the number of training examples or samples that a machine learning algorithm requires in order to be able to accurately learn a task or make accurate predictions. It is a measure of how much data the algorithm needs in order to achieve a certain level of performance. In general, the more complex the task or the more noise or variability in the data, the more samples the algorithm will need in order to learn the task accurately. Conversely, if the task is simple or the data is very clean and well-organized, the algorithm may require fewer samples in order to learn the task. Sample complexity is an important consideration when designing and implementing machine learning algorithms, as it can have a significant impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm. For example, an algorithm with low sample complexity may be able to learn a task quickly and accurately with a small amount of data, while an algorithm with high sample complexity may require a large amount of data and may take longer to learn the task.",wiki_csai,"Please explain what is ""Sample complexity""",ai

"Career mathematicians are people who work in the field of mathematics, which is the study of numbers, quantities, and shapes. Mathematicians use math to solve problems and to understand the world around us. There are many different types of mathematicians, and they do many different things. Some mathematicians work on developing new formulas and rules to help them solve problems. Others use math to make predictions or to understand patterns. Mathematics is important because it helps us understand and solve problems in many different fields, such as science, engineering, economics, and even art. For example, mathematicians might use math to help design safer bridges, create more efficient computer algorithms, or predict the stock market. In order for the field of mathematics to grow, mathematicians need to keep learning new things and asking questions. They also need to share their findings with other mathematicians so that others can build on their work.

"Here 's an explanation as to * why * card counting works . Blackjack , at first glance , may seem like a symmetrical game . Both you and the dealer are trying to accomplish the same goal : get a total as close to 21 as possible without going over . In fact , you could argue that there are certain advantages that the player specifically has . For example , you get paid 3:2 for getting 21 in two cards , you can double your bet if you 're confident that exactly one card will give you a good hand , etc . However , the main thing that puts you at a big disadvantage is that * * if you and the dealer both bust , you automatically lose . * * However , there 's one other advantage that you have . * * The dealer is forced to hit at any total of 16 or lower and , depending on the casino , sometimes soft 17s . You , on the other hand ( no pun intended ) , can hit and stand whenever you want . * * This is actually very useful in basic strategy . If you have a total of 12 and the dealer shows a 5 or 6 , your best option is to stand and hope the dealer busts , which , according to [ this ] ( URL_0 ) , happens 42 % of the time . This mechanic is what card counting takes advantage of . If there are a lot of low cards left in the deck , the dealer is less likely to bust because he / she can increase his / her total by smaller increments , making it easier to reach the safe range of 17 - 21 . Likewise , if there are a lot of high cards left in the deck , the dealer does n't have this privilege . If the dealer shows a 6 , there 's a good chance that the dealer will have a 10 as the hole card , which forces the dealer to hit and very likely to bust .

"It's understandable that you're concerned about your behavior and seeking treatment. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a type of anxiety disorder characterized by obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors. These obsessions and compulsions can interfere with a person's daily life and cause significant distress. If you think you may have OCD, it's important to seek help from a mental health professional. They can help you to understand your thoughts and behaviors, and develop strategies to manage them. Treatment for OCD usually involves a combination of therapy and medication. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of therapy that is often used to treat OCD. It aims to help people understand the thoughts and behaviors that contribute to their OCD, and to develop strategies to manage them. Medications called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are often used to treat OCD. These medications work by increasing levels of serotonin in the brain, which can help to reduce obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors. It's also important to take care of your physical health, as this can have a positive impact on your mental health. This may include getting regular exercise, eating a healthy diet, and getting enough sleep.

"It's always a good idea to have a retirement savings plan in place, no matter what your career path may be. There are several options you can consider, depending on your financial situation and your goals for retirement.Here are a few options to consider:401(k) plan: This is a retirement savings plan offered by many employers. Contributions are made through payroll deductions, and the funds in your account grow tax-deferred until you withdraw them in retirement. Some employers may offer matching contributions, which can be a great way to boost your savings.Individual Retirement Account (IRA): An IRA is a personal savings plan that you can set up on your own. There are two main types: traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs. Contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, but you'll pay taxes on the money when you withdraw it in retirement. With a Roth IRA, you contribute money that you've already paid taxes on, so the funds in your account grow tax-free and you can withdraw them tax-free in retirement.Pension: A pension is a retirement plan that is sponsored by an employer or union and pays a fixed amount to employees when they retire. Pensions are becoming less common, but if you have the option to participate in one, it can be a good source of income in retirement.Social Security: Social Security is a government-run program that provides a source of income for retired workers. The amount you'll receive in benefits is based on your earnings over your working years.No matter which option you choose, it's important to start saving for retirement as early as possible. The more time you have to save, the more your money has a chance to grow through compound interest. It's also a good idea to diversify your savings among different types of accounts to spread out your risk. Finally, be sure to review your retirement savings plan regularly to make sure it's still on track to meet your goals.",finance,What retirement plans/options should i pick for a relatively unstable career path?,ai

This means , of course , that just behind the metal plate there is * less * air and less pressure , the air is getting pushed out of the way by the plate and it has to rush in behind it to fill in the void at the back . This is essentially drag , we 're all familiar with this and it 's vital to things like drafting . But now comes the interesting part : Tilt the plate forwards , let 's say by 45 ° . Now your high pressure area is going to be slightly * below * the plate and the low pressure area is going to be slightly * above * .

Notice that nowhere did I mention the wing has to have a special "" airfoil "" shape to it . In truth , the airfoil shape of wings is not strictly necessary . It 's there because it makes planes more efficient but really you can get perfectly good lift from a flat piece of metal . A wing will still generate lift when upside - down because it 's fundamental shape has n't changed : it 's still pretty much a flat piece of metal . The fact that the airfoil shape is now upside down only means that the wing is less efficient , so the plane may be slower and probably a bit more unstable , but it * will * still generate lift .

"Ants are actually very important insects in the environment! They serve a lot of different roles that help keep things running smoothly. Here are a few ways that ants are helpful:\n\nAnts are great at finding and gathering food. They can find all sorts of things to eat, including seeds, fruits, and even small insects. This helps to spread seeds around and helps plants grow.\n\nAnts are also very good at working together as a team. They have a very organized society, with different ants working together to build their homes, gather food, and take care of their young.\n\nAnts are also important because they help to control other insects. Some ants will eat other insects, while others will use their strong jaws to cut off the wings of flying insects. This helps to keep the population of these insects in check.\n\nAnts are also important because they help to mix and move soil around. As they dig tunnels and move about, they help to loosen up the soil and make it easier for water and air to get in. This helps to keep the soil healthy and supports the growth of plants.\n\nSo, even though ants might be annoying when they get into your house or picnic, they are actually very important insects that play a valuable role in the environment.",reddit_eli5,Are ants good for anything ?

"The octane rating specifies how resistant the fuel is to premature ignition , or "" knocking "" , while being compressed . The octane rating is defined via a mixture of iso - octane ( thus the name ) and n - heptane , where the number is equal to the volume percentage of iso - octane in the mixture that will produce the same knocking behaviour . So , a fuel with octane number 95 will behave the same way as a mixture of 95 % iso - octane and 5 % heptane . The benefit of higher - octane rating fuel is that the mixture of fuel and air that is injected into the cylinder can be compressed more before it is ignited , which leads generally to a more efficient combustion . However , to take advantage of that your engine must be set up to compress that much , so using 98 octane fuel in an engine that is made to run on 95 octane fuel wo n't do any harm , but also wo n't do any good over just using 95 octane fuel .",reddit_eli5,"What is the difference in the octane ratings ( 87 , 89 , 91 ) for gasoline ?

Finally, there is a risk of injury if you accidentally touch the blade while unloading the dishwasher. It's generally best to hand wash sharp knives with care to keep them in good condition and to prevent accidents. To do this, you can use a soft sponge or brush and a mild detergent.

"You 've got the gist . For the long version , here 's a response I typed to a similar question earlier : > In the U.S. : Common - law murder is the intentional taking of a human life with "" malice aforethought . "" In this context , "" malice aforethought "" is a term of art , meaning the defendant did not only intend his actions , but intended that his actions kill the other person . The difference will become more clear in the examples below . > That said , crimes in most states are statutory now , and murder is often split into a number of "" degrees "" ( usually 2 or 3 ) . Nonetheless , all statutory murders fall within this definition . > Before jumping into the different degrees , it 's important to note that the "" malice aforethought "" element can manifest at any time prior to the killing . If I get in a heated argument with someone and decide on the spot to put a letter opener through their eye , I have every bit as much "" malice aforethought "" as someone who has been slowly poisoning their spouse for months . Both are murder . > First Degree Murder : Otherwise known as "" premeditated murder , "" first degree murder requires that the defendant form some plan to effect the killing of the victim in advance . There are different legal tests for deciding whether there was premeditation , but as a general rule of thumb , if the defendant takes some act to prepare himself for the crime ( sharpening a knife , cleaning and loading a gun ) in advance of encountering the victim , that 's usually enough to at least infer premeditation . > Example : D ( defendant ) shoots V ( victim ) in a bar fight . But the prosecution discovers that D purchased his handgun only days before the fight , and discovers a page in D 's journal indicating that V would be at that specific bar at the specific time D ultimately murdered him . It 's not an air tight case for murder one , but it 's enough to infer premeditation . > Second Degree Murder : This is the same as first degree , just without the premeditation . In other words , the Defendant develops his "" malice aforethought "" shortly before the killing , as opposed to deliberating over it and preparing himself in advance of meeting the victim . > Example : D and V get in a bar fight . V knocks D to the ground and walks away . A moment later , D jams a broken bottle into V 's neck , killing him . Here , D clearly intended to kill V ( which makes it murder ) , but there 's nothing really indicating that he planned the situation . > Third Degree : Third degree murder does n't exist in every jurisdiction , and there 's not a one - size fits all definition . Sometimes , it 's just another label for "" voluntary manslaughter "" ( explained below ) , other times , it 's regular second degree murder with a number of mitigating factors . Often times , it 's another label for "" felony murder , "" which is the unintentional killing of a person committed in the course of a violent felony ( e.g. , I drop my gun during a bank robbery and it goes off , accidentally killing the teller ) , as is the case in Florida ( if you 're interested in the Zimmerman case ) . > Manslaughter is a substantially different animal from murder . In generally comes in the voluntary and involuntary flavors . > Voluntary Manslaughter : This is either ( a ) a murder with substantial mitigating factors , or ( b ) a death that results when I intend to inflict serious bodily harm on another . In the first case , "" malice aforethought "" is still present , but there are factors making the killer less culpable , such as a serious provocation . > Example : D catches V in bed with his wife , an brains him with the lamp by the table , killing him . D intended to kill V , but he was provoked by V 's banging of his wife . Note that the reasonableness of the provocation is often an issue here , and some jurisdictions are trending away from mitigating murder to voluntary manslaughter based on certain provocations . > Example : D and V get in a barfight . D stabs V in the leg with a steak knife , unwittingly severing V 's femoral artery , and V bleeds out in seconds . D certainly intended to seriously hurt V , but he did n't intend to kill him . But his intentional act nonetheless caused D 's death . > Involuntary Manslaughter : As the name implies , this is the unintentional taking of a human life . But , for such a killing to be criminally culpable , the Defendant must have killed the Victim in the course of some criminal act or with some level of criminal culpability . In the U.S. , the lowest level of criminal liability is gross / criminal negligence ( which is a higher standard than regular negligence you often encounter in civil cases ) . So if you kill someone as a result of your criminally negligent , reckless , or intentional conduct , you commit involuntary manslaughter . > Example : D is driving 90 mph through a residential neighborhood when he loses control of his car and strikes V in his front yard , killing him . Here , D is almost certainly grossly negligent or reckless , and V died as a direct result of his actions , D has committed involuntary manslaughter . > I hope this helps . Please note that the examples are not perfect ; some of them could arguably be chargeable as a different offense , and others may be subject to some defense or justification .",reddit_eli5,What is the difference between manslaughter and murder exactly ?

"Sure! String theory is a way that scientists try to understand how the tiny things that make up our world work. They think that everything in the universe is made up of tiny strings, and that these strings can vibrate in different ways to create all the different things that we see around us. Imagine that you have a long, thin rubber band. If you stretch it out and pluck it, it will make a sound. If you pluck it harder, it will make a higher pitched sound. And if you pluck it softer, it will make a lower pitched sound. Now, imagine that instead of a rubber band, you have a tiny string. This string can also vibrate and make different sounds, but the sounds it makes are so high-pitched that we can't hear them. Scientists think that these tiny vibrations of the strings are what create all the different particles and forces in the universe. So, string theory is a way to try to understand how everything in the universe is connected and how it all works together.

"A silent letter is a letter in a word that is not pronounced when the word is spoken. Silent letters are often used in English spelling to show the relationship between words or to indicate the origin of a word.

The ""j"" in ""Django"" is also silent because it is used to indicate that the word comes from a French word. The ""l"" in ""freljord"" is silent because it is used to show that the word is related to other words like ""frost"" and ""freeze,"" which come from a different language. Silent letters can be tricky because they are not pronounced, but they are still important because they can change the meaning of a word. For example, the word ""knight"" is spelled with a ""k"" but it is not pronounced, so it is not the same as the word ""night,"" which is pronounced with a ""k"" sound.

However, it is not impossible to get a mortgage while self-employed.

A high credit score will give you a better chance of getting approved for a mortgage.Provide documentation of your income: Lenders will want to see proof of your income to determine if you can afford the mortgage payments.

They may be able to help you find a lender who is more willing to work with self-employed individuals.Consider a government-backed loan: Government-backed loans, such as FHA or VA loans, may be more forgiving of self-employment and may have more flexible requirements.It is also a good idea to shop around and compare mortgage offers from multiple lenders to find the best deal.",finance,Getting a mortgage while self-employed,ai

"I'm sorry to hear that you have been suffering from thrombocytopenia for 8 months. Thrombocytopenia is a condition in which there is a low number of platelets in the blood. Platelets are important for blood clotting, so having a low number of them can lead to bleeding and bruising. There are several medications that can be used to treat thrombocytopenia, depending on the underlying cause of the condition. Some of these medications include: Corticosteroids: These medications, such as prednisone, can help to increase the production of platelets in the bone marrow. Immunoglobulins: These medications, such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), can help to increase the number of platelets in the blood by suppressing the immune system. Platelet transfusions: If the platelet count is very low, a platelet transfusion may be necessary to increase the number of platelets in the blood. Thrombopoietin receptor agonists: These medications, such as eltrombopag and romiplostim, can help to increase the production of platelets in the bone marrow. It is important to work closely with a healthcare provider to determine the best treatment approach for your specific case. If you have APS (antiphospholipid syndrome), which is a condition in which the body produces abnormal antibodies that increase the risk of blood clots, your healthcare provider may recommend additional treatments, such as anticoagulants (blood thinners) to reduce the risk of blood clots.

As I understand it, this means I cannot deduct trips from home to another work location (e.g., going to a client's home or office to do work there). I do not think this is true. You cannot deduct trips to your main business location, i.e.: you cannot deduct trips to your office or client's location if this is your main client and you routinely work on-site. However, if you only visit your clients on occasion for specific events while doing your routine work at home - you can definitely deduct those trips. The deduction of the home usage itself has nothing to do with it. However, there's a different reason they refer to pub 587. Your home must qualify as principal place of business (even if it doesn't qualify for deduction). The qualifications of ""principal place of business"" are described in pub 587. ""if for some personal reason you do not go directly from one location to the other, you cannot deduct more than the amount it would have cost you to go directly from the first location to the second."" What is not clear to me is what exactly is deductible if there are significant time gaps (within a single day) between trips to different clients. You got it right. What this quote means is that if you have client A and client B, and you drive from A to B - you can only deduct the travel between A and B, nothing else. I.e.: if you have 2 hours to kill and you take a trip to the mall - you cannot deduct the mileage attributable to that trip. You only deduct the actual distance between A and B as it would be had you driven from A to B directly. The example you cite re first client being considered as the place of business is for the case where your home doesn't qualify as principal place of business. In this case you start counting miles from your first client, and only for direct trips from client to client. If you only have 1 client in that day, tough luck, nothing to deduct. Also, it's not clear whether stopoffs between clients would really be ""personal reasons"", since the appointment times are often set by the client, so it's not as if the delay between A and B was just because I felt like it; there was never the option of going directly from A to B. That's what is called ""facts and circumstances"". You can argue that you had enough time between meetings to go back to your home office to continue working. The IRS agent auditing you (and you're likely to get audited) will consider that. Maybe will accept it. Maybe not. If I had a gap like that described above, I could save on my taxes by going to the park or a hamburger stand instead of going home between A and B But then you wouldn't be at home, so why would it be ""principal place of business"" if you're not there? Boom, lost deduction for the trip to the first client. I suggest you talk to a licensed tax adviser (EA/CPA licensed in your State). You're dealing with deductions that are considered ""red flags"" for the IRS. I.e.: many people believe that these deductions (business use of your home/car) trigger audits. To substantiate business use of your car you need to keep very good track of your travels (literally travel log, they sell them at Staples), and make sure to distinguish between personal travel and business travel, keep proofs that the meetings took place (although keeping a log is a requirement, it can be backdated/faked, so if audited - the IRS will want to see more than your own documentation). A good tax adviser will educate you on all these rules, and also clarify the complexities you were asking about here. I'm not a tax adviser, so don't rely on this answer when you're preparing your tax return or responding to the IRS audit. In your edit you ask this: Specifically, what I'm wondering is whether it is possible for a home to qualify as a ""principal place of business"" for purposes of deducting car expenses but not for the home office deduction. The answer is yes. Deductibility is determined by exclusivity of use, among other things. But the fact that you manage your business from your kitchen doesn't make your kitchen any less of a principal place of business. It is non-deductible because you also cook your dinners there, but it is still, nonetheless, your principal place of business. The Pub 587 which I linked to has these qualifications: Your home office will qualify as your principal place of business if you meet the following requirements. You use it exclusively and regularly for administrative or management activities of your trade or business. You have no other fixed location where you conduct substantial administrative or management activities of your trade or business. As you see, exclusivity of the usage of your home area is not a requirement here. The ""exclusively and regularly"" in the quote refers to your business not using any other location, and managing it from home regularly. I.e.: if you manage your business a day in a year - that's not enough for it to be considered principal. If you manage your business from your office and your home - you cannot consider home as principal.",finance,Car expense deductions with multiple work locations,human

"Sure! I'll do my best to explain this in a way that's easy to understand. All living things need energy to survive and grow. We get this energy by using the food we eat. But in order to use the energy in food, our bodies need oxygen. Oxygen helps our cells turn the energy in food into a form that our bodies can use. So when we breathe in oxygen, it goes into our bodies and is used by our cells to make energy. As a byproduct of this process, our cells also produce carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is a gas that our bodies don't need, so we breathe it out. Oxygen is special because it's the only gas that our bodies can use to make energy.

"An MRI of the brain is a medical imaging test that uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of the brain. The report you provided describes several findings on the MRI scan. A lacunar infarct is a type of small stroke that occurs when a small blood vessel in the brain becomes blocked, disrupting blood flow to a small area of brain tissue. The presence of a small chronic lacunar infarct means that there is a small area of brain tissue that has been damaged due to a previous stroke. A dilated perivascular space is a small fluid-filled area around a blood vessel in the brain. The presence of a dilated perivascular space in the posterior left centrum semiolale suggests that there may be some swelling or inflammation in this area of the brain. The MRI report also mentions a small chronic lacunar infarct in the left thalamus, which is an area of the brain involved in movement, sensory processing, and regulation of sleep and wakefulness. The report states that there is no evidence of restricted diffusion, which means that the MRI did not detect any areas of the brain that are experiencing a sudden lack of blood flow, which can occur during an acute stroke. The report mentions that there is a mildly prominent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) overlying the cerebral hemispheres, which may be due to moderate generalized cerebral and cerebellar volume loss. This means that there is an abnormal amount of CSF present in the brain, which may be due to a decrease in the volume of brain tissue. The ventricles and basilar cisterns, which are fluid-filled spaces within the brain, are described as being normal in size. Overall, the MRI report suggests that there are some areas of brain tissue damage and swelling present, but no evidence of an acute stroke or other serious brain injury. It is important to note that this interpretation is based on the information provided in the report and a complete evaluation of the MRI scan would require a more detailed review by a healthcare professional.",medicine,What does the brain MRI report indicate?What does the following MRI of the brain report mean?

"Electronics require specific voltages because different components are designed to work with specific voltage ranges. For example, a microcontroller might be designed to work with a voltage range of 3.3 volts to 5 volts, so it would require a power source that provides a voltage within that range.\n\nThe specific voltages like 3.3v, 5v, and 12v are chosen based on the needs of the component and the available power sources. For example, a device that runs on batteries might use a lower voltage, like 3.3v, to extend the battery life. A device that is plugged into a wall outlet might use a higher voltage, like 12v, to get more power.\n\nThere is no specific reason why we don't see household devices that require 10v.

"Motion capture is a technology that allows game developers to record the movements of people and animals and use that data to create realistic animations in their games. It has been used in the game industry for many years, but it has become more popular and more advanced in recent years. Before motion capture, game developers had to create animations manually, which was a very time-consuming process. They would have to draw each frame of the animation by hand, or use computers to create the animations from scratch. This was not very efficient, and it was difficult to create realistic animations this way. To use motion capture, game developers set up a special studio with many cameras that are pointed at the person or animal whose movements they want to capture. The person or animal wears a special suit with markers on it, which the cameras can track. As the person or animal moves, the cameras record their movements and send the data to a computer. The computer then translates that data into an animation that the game can use. So motion capture makes it easier for game developers to create realistic animations, because they can just record the real movements of people and animals instead of having to create the animations by hand.",reddit_eli5,"When did game developers start to use motion capture and how does it work ?

"I'm glad keshlam and Bobby mentioned there are free tools, both from the IRS and private software companies. Also search for Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) in your area for individual help with your return. A walk-in tax clinic strength is tax preparation. CPAs and EAs provide a higher level of service. For example, they compile and review your prior year's return and your current year, although that is not relevant to your current situation. EAs and CPAs are allowed to represent you before the IRS. They can directly meet or contact the IRS and navigate audits and other requests on your behalf. Outside of tax season, an accountant can help you with tax planning and other taxable events. Some people do not hire a CPA or EA until they need representation. Establishing a relationship and familiarity with an accountant now can save time and money if you do anticipate you will need representation later. Part of what makes the tax code complicated is it can use very specific definitions of a common word. Furthermore, the specific definition of a phrase or word can change between publications. Also, the tax code uses all-encompassing definitions and provide detailed and lengthy lists that are not exhaustive; you may not find your situation listed or described in the tax code, yet you are responsible for reporting your taxable events. The best software cannot navigate you through your tax situation like an accountant. Lastly, some of the smartest people I have met are accountants and to get the most out of meeting with them you should be as familiar as possible with your position.

"When the wind blows, it can make you feel colder because it increases the rate at which heat is lost from your body. Your body gives off heat all the time, and this heat is lost to the air around you. When the air is still, the heat loss is slower, but when the air is moving (such as when it's windy), the heat loss is faster. This is why you may feel colder on a windy day, even if the temperature is the same as on a calm day. Imagine you are outside on a cold day, and you are wearing a coat to keep you warm. The coat helps to trap a layer of warm air next to your skin, which helps to keep you warm. However, if the wind is blowing, it can blow this warm air away from your body and replace it with colder air. This can make you feel colder, even if the temperature hasn't actually changed. The wind chill factor is a way to measure how cold the wind makes it feel. It takes into account both the temperature and the wind speed to give a ""feels like"" temperature. So, for example, if the temperature is 10 degrees Fahrenheit and the wind speed is 20 miles per hour, the wind chill would be -9 degrees Fahrenheit, which means it would feel like 9 degrees colder than the actual temperature.",reddit_eli5,Wind chill Why does the wind blowing make an already cold day colder ?

"Sure! When light hits an object, it can either be absorbed by the object, transmitted (passed) through the object, or reflected off the object. When light is reflected off an object, it bounces off the surface of the object in a specific way. Imagine you are bouncing a ball off a wall. When the ball hits the wall, it bounces back in the opposite direction. Light works in a similar way. When light hits the surface of an object, it bounces back in the opposite direction. The reason that the material reflecting the light does not absorb the light is because the surface of the material is not able to absorb the light. Different materials absorb light in different ways. For example, a black shirt absorbs more light than a white shirt. This is why a black shirt feels hotter on a sunny day than a white shirt. The black shirt absorbs more of the light and turns it into heat, while the white shirt reflects more of the light and does not get as hot.",reddit_eli5,How does light reflect off objects on a microscopic level ?

"It is possible that the tingling sensation in your left leg could be related to your bicuspid aortic valve or it could be caused by something else. It is important to speak with a healthcare professional to determine the cause of the tingling and determine the appropriate treatment. A bicuspid aortic valve is a congenital heart condition in which the aortic valve, which controls blood flow from the heart to the rest of the body, has only two leaflets instead of three. This can cause the valve to become narrowed or leaky, leading to heart problems. However, tingling in the legs is not typically a symptom of a bicuspid aortic valve. It is possible that the tingling sensation in your leg could be caused by a condition such as peripheral neuropathy, which is damage to the nerves that carry messages to and from the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body. Peripheral neuropathy can be caused by a variety of factors, including diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, and nerve compression. Prolonged sitting can also contribute to the development of peripheral neuropathy, as it can cause decreased blood flow to the legs.

"Flat soda, or soda that has lost its carbonation, may taste different to some people because the carbonation can affect the way that the flavors of the soda are perceived. When you drink a carbonated beverage, the bubbles can stimulate your taste buds and cause you to taste the flavors of the drink more intensely. When the carbonation is gone, the flavors may taste less intense or different than they did when the drink was carbonated. Another reason that flat soda may taste different is that it can become stale over time. When soda is left open, the sugars and flavors in the drink can start to break down and change, which can affect the taste. So, while the carbonation in soda may not directly affect the flavor of the drink, it can change the way that the flavors are perceived, and flat soda may taste different due to changes in the flavors over time.",reddit_eli5,why does flat pop taste terrible ?

"The IRA, or Irish Republican Army, was a militant organization that sought to end British rule in Northern Ireland and unite the island of Ireland. The organization used violent tactics, including bombings, to achieve its goals. The conflict in Northern Ireland, often referred to as ""The Troubles,"" has its roots in the partition of Ireland in the 1920s, when the majority Protestant region of Ulster in the north was separated from the predominantly Catholic rest of the island and remained part of the United Kingdom. Many Irish Catholics, especially in Northern Ireland, opposed this arrangement and sought a united Ireland. The IRA was formed to fight for Irish independence and the reunification of Ireland. The Troubles were a period of sectarian violence and political conflict in Northern Ireland from the late 1960s to the late 1990s. The IRA and other militant groups, including Protestant paramilitary organizations, carried out bombings and other attacks in an effort to achieve their political objectives. The violence was often brutal and resulted in the deaths of thousands of people. The conflict was eventually resolved through a peace process that resulted in the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, which established a power-sharing government in Northern Ireland and set out a framework for relations between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.

"Sure! Imagine you're a caveman or cavewoman living with your family and friends. You want to communicate with them and share your thoughts, feelings, and ideas. You might use gestures, facial expressions, and sounds to get your message across. Over time, early humans started to use more and more sounds to communicate. They made grunts, growls, and other noises to express themselves. They also started to use words to describe things, like ""fire"" for the flame that kept them warm and ""water"" for the liquid they drank. As humans started to use more and more words, they realized that they could put them together to make more complex ideas. For example, they could say ""I see a big animal"" to describe an animal they saw in the distance. They could also use verbs, which are words that describe actions, like ""run"" or ""jump."" As humans continued to communicate with each other, their language became more and more sophisticated. They developed different sounds for different words and started to use grammar, which is the way we put words together in a sentence to convey a meaning.

Some individuals may benefit from diet modification, such as a reduced-fat diet, following cholecystectomy since it may be more difficult for digestion of fatty foods.

"Yikes .. the amount of misinformation here . Yeah the whole idea of everything moving towards disorder and decay is very poetic and somewhat based in a scientific principle , but firstly that 's the 2nd law of thermodynamics , not a definition of entropy , and secondly I 'm pretty sure a junior engineering student is aware of that simplification and looking for something a little more scientifically rigorous . Disorder is one definition , but a somewhat ambiguous and debated term these days . It makes it easy to grasp at first , but as you learn more can lead to some confusion and the kinds of misinformation I 'm seeing here . Granted I 'm no expert either , but here 's my take : Entropy you can consider a sort of measure of how easily or impossibly reversible a process is . For a more tangible example : an object falling from a higher place to a low place is a relatively small change of entropy . Assuming the system as simply the object , you need to input energy into the system ( pick it up ) to restore it to it 's old state but that 's pretty easy . Let 's say the object cracks during the fall . Well the change in entropy just got a little higher because you got ta do some more work ( input more energy ) to mend that crack . Now say the object shatters into a hundred pieces , it will be even harder to restore it . You 'll have to work to pick up all the pieces , rearrange them back to their original state , and then somehow bind them back together . Thus that 's a much higher change of entropy . And so on .. In physics this concept is important because things naturally want to go to a state of higher entropy ( 2nd law thermodynamics ) , enough so that it can happen spontaneously without outside input . This is what drives so many things , like heat flowing for hot areas to cold areas or pressure gradients in a system tending to equalize or dispersal of particles . Entropy is how you describe that change . In a closed system , if ice melts in water , the ice got warmer but the water got colder , and the total heat / energy in the system is the same ( ignoring heat of fusion ) . In a closed system , if a bunch of grouped together particles dissipate and spread out , the overall mass / density of that system is still the same . So what changed ?

"First off , I think you need to make a distinction between outsourcing and offshoring clear . Outsourcing merely refers to an organisation contracting with a third party to do work for them , with the expectation that the third party will be able to do so more cheaply or efficiently . For instance , I used to work for an insurance company who , as a result of numerous mergers , had many different types of legacy policies that were no longer actively sold , held on many different legacy systems . They were getting rid of older systems where they could to make their IT infrastructure more efficient , but it was a fairly arduous process . So , they contracted with a third party who already had a system that they claimed could quite happily deal with all of the legacy policies satisfactorily to administer them on their behalf . This third party now manages these policies , and all the staff who were working on these policies are now employed by this third party . Offshoring refers to the practice of relocating work from one country to another , usually one where certain costs , such as land or labour , can be had significantly more cheaply , or there are fewer requirements that must be met ( such as labour laws , health and safety provisions and so on ) . While sometimes the company will deal with this themselves , it 's very common to deal with a third party in the country work is being relocated to who will directly employ the new employees , thus making offshoring a type of outsourcing in many cases . The theory behind outsourcing is that by putting the process out to tender , the most efficient partners can be chosen , and a business can concentrate on what it does well . Also , if a third party deals with multiple partners in this way , they can benefit from economies of scale due to the volume of work they do - for instance , it should be more efficient for one company to run 60 different workplace canteens than for 60 different companies to run their own , because a company with 60 different canteens is going to be buying supplies in far higher volumes , and so is more likely to be able to get bulk discounts and negotiate better deals , thus driving costs down . However , in my experience the differences between company cultures and processes can make it very difficult to get anything done when dealing with an aspect of the work that involves the third party - it becomes horribly bureaucratic . With offshoring , I 've found that the differing attitudes and expectations between cultures can be a barrier . Also , customers are n't always entirely happy with dealing with someone in another country ( sometimes because they have trouble dealing with an accent , or they perceive that the company is being a cheapskate and getting cheap but poor quality customer service staff , and occasionally because someone is just plain racist ) . Also , it very often does n't work out anything like as cheap as the offshoring companies like to claim - the labour costs might be reduced , but it will mean training up a lot of new staff - fine for quite basic tasks , but if it 's even slightly complex , then it may well take years before the new employees are up to the standards of their predecessors . In addition , the fairness of offshoring and outsourcing to existing employees is at least somewhat questionable . Also , slightly tongue in cheek here , but an interesting point nonetheless - why should it be the company that outsources the job and pockets the difference ? Why should n't you or I be able to outsource our own jobs ?",reddit_eli5,Why is outsourcing a good thing ? Why do some people consider it bad ? Explain like I'm five.,human

"Computers can have 128 gigabytes of RAM, or even more. However, it's not as simple as just putting a 128 gigabyte RAM chip into a computer.RAM stands for ""random access memory,"" and it's used by the computer to store data that it needs to access quickly while it's running programs. The computer's processor retrieves data from the RAM when it needs it, and stores data in the RAM when it's done with it.Flash drives also store data, but they use a different type of technology called ""flash memory."" Flash memory is a type of non-volatile memory, which means it can retain data even when the power is turned off. This is why you can store files on a flash drive and then use them on a different computer.RAM is different because it is volatile memory, which means it is only used to store data while the computer is turned on. When the computer is turned off, the data in the RAM is lost.Because of this, computers need a way to store data permanently, even when they're turned off. That's where the hard drive comes in. The hard drive is a type of non-volatile storage that can store large amounts of data even when the power is turned off.So, while it's possible for computers to have 128 gigabytes of RAM, they also need a hard drive to store data permanently. Flash drives are much smaller than hard drives, which is why they can have a lot of storage in a small space.",reddit_eli5,"Why ca n't computers have 128 Gigabytes of RAM like a flash drive ?

"Well for starters you want to rent it for more than the apartment costs you. Aside from mortgage you have insurance, and maintenance costs. If you are going to have a long term rental property you need to make a profit, or at a bare minimum break even. Personally I would not like the break even option because there are unexpected costs that turn break even into a severe loss. Basically the way I would calculate the minimum rent for an apartment I owned would be: (Payment + (taxes/12) + (other costs you provide) + (Expected annual maintenance costs)) * 100% + % of profit I want to make. This is a business arrangement. Unless you are recouping some of your losses in another manner then it is bad business to maintain a business relationship that is costing you money. The only thing that may be worth considering is what comparable rentals go for in your area. You may be forced to take a loss if the rental market in your area is depressed. But I suspect that right now your condo is renting at a steal of a rate. I would also suspect that the number you get from the above formula falls pretty close to what the going rate in your area is.",finance,What are the basics of apartment rental finances?,human

"Metal music is a genre of rock music that typically features distorted and amplified guitar riffs, fast-paced tempos, and aggressive or intense lyrics. It often incorporates elements of other musical styles, such as classical music and folk music, and sometimes includes elements of horror, science fiction, and fantasy. Metal music can be further divided into subgenres, such as heavy metal, thrash metal, and death metal, each of which has its own distinctive characteristics and themes.\n\nIn general, metal music is known for its high-energy and intense sound, and it often addresses themes of rebellion, individualism, and social or political issues. Some metal lyrics may also explore more personal themes, such as relationships, self-discovery, and personal struggles. Metal music often appeals to fans who enjoy its raw, powerful sound and its emphasis on individual expression and emotion.",open_qa,what is metal music about,ai
